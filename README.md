# byt-descendants-portal

This repo contains the microcontroller code for a system that drives ~2000 WS2812 ("NeoPixel") LEDs
for a community theater production of Disney's "Descendants" musical. The LEDs are arranged in
two adjacent vertical circles to form a "magical portal" set piece. The system can be controlled via
DMX, although the animations are generated procedurally by the device firmware.
